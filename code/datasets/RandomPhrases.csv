 She likes spaggeti
 He loves votka
 Football is a fun sport
 Thats one small step for man one giant leap for mankind 
 Put a Sock In It
 Fish Out Of Water
 Drive Me Nuts
 Right Off the Bat
 I Smell a Rat
 Don't Count Your Chickens Before They Hatch
 Talk the Talk
Foaming At The Mouth
Rain on Your Parade
Hard Pill to Swallow
Swinging For the Fences
Drawing a Blank
You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover
Par For the Course
Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining
Cut The Mustard
In a Pickle
And he turns himself in a Pickle man i swear its the funnies stuff i  have ever seen
Head Over Heels
If You Can't Stand the Heat Get Out of the Kitchen
Ride Him Cowboy!
Hollow points in yo' direction
Rolling up the lettuce
I hate to disappoint
Just lace me down in grey and black
Just move back
Tell me if I'm looking better
I've just been so fed up
My momma said I'm acting kinda different
Hope I find the truth while I'm alive
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
And all that glitters is gold
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
Hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (on the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been…
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh the less I know the better
The less I know the better
Oh my love can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
She said "It's not now or never
Wait ten years we'll be together"
I said "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Oh my love can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could…
Oh my love can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
I was doing fine without you
'Til I saw your face now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want is this who you are?
I was doing fine without you
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh sweet darling where he wants you
It's always around me all this noise but
Not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen let it happen"
(It's gonna feel so good)
"Just let it happen let it happen"
All this running around
Tryin' to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside
Now all the others seem shallow
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
It must be morning
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound and
When it happens when it happens
(I won't be holding on)
So let it happen let it happen
All this running around
I can't fight it much longer
Something's tryin' to get out
And it's never been closer
If my take-off fails
Make up some other story
But if I never come back…
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes
I believed without a question always
To save all of us you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise-up as I grow
And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still have time you had a chance
But you decided to take all of your sorrys to the grave
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise-up as I grow
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I
Poolside convo about your summer last night ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me for me
I'll sleep between y'all it's nothing
It's no thing it's nothing
Keep a place for me for me
Now and then you miss it sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never 'cause I made you use…
Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle.
She has never fallen before and she will not fall tonight.
Those are Thenns on our walls 
they eat the flesh of the men they kill! 
Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight? Tonight we fight!
And when the sun rises 
I promise you Castle Black will stand!
The Night's Watch will stand! With me now now with me
Ygritte spies on the castle to scout numbers of defenders.
She reports to the other wildlings that most of the guards are at the top of the Wall and that few are left in the Castle.
The group prepares to attack while Ygritte seems to have second thoughts.
The Thenn warg suddenly snaps out of his trance and informs the group that the signal has been given
prompting the wildlings to immediately approach Castle Black's southern gate. North of the Wall
Mance delivers on his promise to "light the biggest fire the North has ever seen"
and the massive wildling army emerges from the woods their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths.
Alliser Thorne orders the archers on the Wall to nock their arrows but they draw instead while Grenn accidentally drops a barrel down the Wall.
Alliser angrily drills his men on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at Castle Black
signaling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund's band of wildlings at the castle's southern entrance.
Realizing the dire need for experienced men to defend the keep from the surprise attack
Alliser orders Janos Slynt to assume command of the Wall's defenses and heads below to join the melee.
After Edmure weds Roslin Lord Walder hosts a feast for the highborn in one of his castles while a "bastard feast" for lesser ranks is held in the second castle.Common soldiers celebrate in tents outside the castle. The Freys provide wagons and casks of ale mead and wine to their guests.[11][6]
Performed songs include "Alysanne"
"Flowers of Spring" "Iron Lances"
and "The Queen Took Off Her Sandal
the King Took Off His Crown".
A drunken Greatjon Umber bellows "The Bear and the Maiden Fair".
Robb dances with Roslin
several other Freys
and Dacey Mormont.
Several poor dishes are served
the most appetizing being pink lamb.
Roose toasts Walder's grandsons
Big Walder and Little Walder
who are in the care of Roose's son
Ramsay Snow after the sack of Winterfell.
As part of the bedding custom
Edmure and Roslin depart the hall in the company of many guests of the opposite gender.
By using sellswords and knights at the feast disguised as musicians 
and getting Robb's men too drunk to fight 
Lord Walder Frey is able to coordinate a massacre with little loss to his own men.
While the unknowing Edmure beds Roslin
the twin castles and the outlying camp are signalled when the band in Walder's hall begins playing "The Rains of Castamere".
Few of the northmen in the hall have a chance to react
and most are butchered on the spot by the musicians' crossbows or Frey knives.
Ser Ryman Frey leads Frey men-at-arms with longaxes.
